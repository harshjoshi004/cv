      To introduce someone, <b>you should politely give details</b> about the person to whom you are introducing him or
      her.
      You allow them to start a <i>Good and productive </i>conversation and create an opportunity to know each other.
      Yet, the expressions that you
      use to introduce may vary depending on the context: formal or informal.
      However, if you are looking for a platform where you can <mark>practice English and master your desired
        English</mark> skills,
